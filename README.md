# task
A system for managing day to day task

A project given to me to test my ability with frontend frameworks, manageing state effectively, integrate with APIs, and creating a well-organized and maintainable codebase.

This project is built with;

HTML - for structure,
CSS - for styling,
TailwindCSS - a css framework to design software faster,
JavaScript - an Object Oriented Programming Language for to make the software dynamic,
Axios - a javascript library to make API calls
Redux and Redux thunk - for managing state.

To run the software;
- clone the code,
- Open the code on your Integrated Development Environment (eg. VSCode)
- Open the terminal, make sure you have node.js installed on your system to automatically install Node Package Manager (NPM),
in the terminal
- Make sure the path in your terminal is pointing to the base directory(i.e. the folder that contains all the code)
- Type "npm install" and run in your terminal, this ensure all dependencies and libraries used for the project are installed.
- Type "npm start" to run the code, if all instructions are followed, the code will run and the web app will open on your default browser automatically, if it didn't open automatically. you have to follow the path shown on your terminal to access the web app.
- Thank you.
